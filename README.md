# Operating-Systems-WUT

This repository contains projects created for the Operating Systems course at Warsaw University of Technology.

It consists of two projects. The first one simulates a simple file system in a binary file, and the second one demonstrates the usage of semaphores. Details on each project can be found in readmes in their directories.
